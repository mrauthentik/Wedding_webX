                                <p>Hi I am Victor Chukwu, I surrendered my life to Christ in November 2014 and joined the Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide to build, establish, and grow in the truth, righteousness, and holiness. An intentional decision that I will never regret, and which, I will always be eternally grateful to our Lord Jesus Christ for pulling me out of the muck and setting my feet on his rock. Since then, by his grace, I have  been devoted and committed to living my life for Christ. 

                                    As I matured in Christ, I started to understand the spiritual significance of getting married in accordance with God's will and the negative effects of acting otherwise. The urge to pray for a marital partner increased as a result of having this in my heart and the spiritual counselling I had received. After reading the book on "Knowing the will of God to your wedding ceremony" , I made the decision to seriously and resolutely commit myself to all forms of prayer, fasting, and unwavering faith in the Lord until I received an assurance of peace in my heart regarding the spouse the Lord was going to guide me to. 
                                    
                                    Unexpectedly, the Lord didn't take long to reveal Sister Zoqueen to me in a dream. I prayed to the Lord for additional assurance because I was gobsmacked and shy about it. It's interesting how the Lord started to baptise me with a tremendous marital love for her.  The Lord gave me more peace, pleasure, and wonderful confidence as I prayed, studied, and listened to his word. This verse from Hebrews 6:10 KJV blessed me in my studies. "For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister". God didn't just affirm it; he did it often and in very unusual and extraordinary ways. Glory to the Lord in the highest! O Yes! the Lord answers Prayers. I am incredibly appreciative in Jesus' name, Amen, may the Lord perfect the marvellous plans he has begun in our lives.</p>

                                <p>Hi I am ZoQueen Adanne, In March 2020, I gave my life to Christ, in holiness and righteousness. I joined Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide and my life has never been the same. Jesus turned me from darkness to light, transformed my life in and out, and gave me a new heart. Since then, by his grace, I have been living my life for him and him alone. 

                                    Now in Christ, I quickly understand the importance of marrying in the will of God.
                                    So I prayed, fasted , and trusted the Lord for a life partner. God gave me this scripture, Habakkuk 2:2-3 “And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry”. After reading this, I was completely at peace.
                                    
                                    It was not long until the Lord started to minister to me concerning Brother Victor, that he is the will of God for me. But, I still continued to pray. When I saw that the ministration became frequent, I asked God to confirm what the Holy Spirit was ministering to me. Not only did God confirm it, he did so multiple times in very unique ways. Praise the Lord! God answers prayers! I am very grateful. May The Lord complete the marvelous thing he has started in our lives in Jesus Name, Amen!</p>
